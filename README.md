Objective: To create a sleek and functional car blogging website that allows users to create, manage, and share blogs. The project aimed to test and implement the skills I’ve learned so far, particularly in React, Recoil state management, backend integration, folder structuring, error handling, and responsive design.



SuperCarBlog is a platform where car enthusiasts can:
	1.	Sign up/Login: Users can create an account or sign in using secure authentication (JWT).
	2.	User Profile Management: Users can upload their profile photos using Cloudinary and store the image URLs in MongoDB.
	3.	Create and Manage Blogs: Users can write, edit, and delete their blogs with a simple and intuitive interface.
	4.	Secure Password Management: Passwords are securely hashed using Bcrypt.
	5.	Themes: Implemented a variety of themes with DaisyUI to enhance user experience.
	6.	Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI for optimal usability on all devices.
	7.	Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling applied across both frontend and backend.

The application is hosted with the backend deployed on Render and the frontend on Netlify. CORS policies were implemented to enable secure communication between the frontend and backend.
